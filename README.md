# DBMS

This repository is about DataBase Management System.  
This repository covers making my own `DBMS`, starting from the bottom(Disk Space Manager).  
<br/>

## 1. SQL query
Before we begin the main project, you can watch some SQL query project.  
[MySQL - Pokemon mini Project](https://github.com/kangjunseo/DBMS/tree/main/MySQL%20Practice/Pokemon%20Project)  
<br/>
In `Schema.sql`, you can see the overall schema SQL of this project.  
Before you watch each Query SQL, please read or download `number_info.txt` which covers the information what each query covers.  
Then, feel free to watch my 40 Query SQLs.  
<br/>
You can execute my codes right now to click [HERE](https://www.db-fiddle.com/).  
In Schema SQL, please copy and paste my `Schema.sql`.  
In Query SQL, put each sql query (e.g., `01.sql`,`17.sql`, ...).  
<br/>

## 2. Disk-based B+ Tree
